So I just grab the FeatureID and Google it.

They might retire or look for bigger challenges. Either way as an Office 365 Administrator you have to deal with the situation.

But that is not the case with the Whiteboard Service.</description></item><item><title>Office365-CLI in a Nano Server Container</title><link>http://kolislab.com/post/office365-cli-in-a-nano-server-container/</link><pubDate>Wed, 06 Jun 2018 21:23:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://kolislab.com/post/office365-cli-in-a-nano-server-container/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;m in general interested in everything OfficeDevPnP but I&amp;rsquo;m not a developer. I like to think that I&amp;rsquo;m a Hacker, the old school &amp;ldquo;do something which wasn&amp;rsquo;t designed&amp;rdquo; type of hacker.
These days I&amp;rsquo;m experimenting with Docker and I wanted to play with the Office365-CLI and I thought why not run it from a Docker container. And maybe, just to make it more interesting run it from a Nano Server.</description></item></channel></rss>
