[UPDATE] 4/17/2019: Microsoft has restored the previously deactivated blogs. I suggest to save everything you find useful into OneNote and keep them forever!
Note from Twitter
ZDNET wrote an article about the planned clean-up the back in November of 2018: https://www.zdnet.com/article/as-microsoft-moves-more-blogs-off-its-msdn-and-technet-sites-heres-how-to-stay-current/
But oddly this act was a surprise to some current and former MSFT employees: Why was my MSDN blog deleted?</description></item></channel></rss>
