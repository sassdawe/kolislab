      <description>My name is David Sass and this is my professional blog.
I spent the all my career around Microsoft technologies, mostly with SharePoint Server. I was a one man Stable team for a couple of years. - Why? Because the Hungarian companies sometimes like to put everything on one man especially when there is not enough IT Professional on the market.
During those years I managed to meet all kinds of challenges in the SharePoint space - we all know the developers and the crazy expectations of the project managers, right?</description>
