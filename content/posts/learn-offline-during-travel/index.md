If you want to get the most out of your time during travelling, on a train, on an airplane or just on public transportation - if you live in a city where this is an option -  I suggest the use **Pluralsight**'s desktop and mobile clients for the experience of offline usage.

You can find the applications download links here [https://www.pluralsight.com/downloads](https://www.pluralsight.com/downloads)
