Without governance one can find itself in a huge mess.

## What is Azure DevOps Governance?

I'm going to borrow from the [SharePoint Maven blog](https://sharepointmaven.com/implement-sharepoint-governance/) [] here and replace the word SharePoint:

> In simple terms, Azure DevOps Governance is a set of policies that define processes, roles, rules and regulations for user interaction with Azure DevOps in your organization. Azure DevOps Governance applies to everyone, no matter of their company role or title or Azure DevOps permission/level of access.

## What are the benefits of Azure DevOps Governance



## What should you Govern in Azure DevOps?

For starter you don't want all your users to go and create Azure DevOps Organizations with funny names and get your company into a situation where you don't know who is doing what and where, with other words you don't want Azure DevOps to become part of the **Shadow IT** problem.
