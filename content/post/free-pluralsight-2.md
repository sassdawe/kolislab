As you might all know. **Microsoft** has a program to help the developers to kick-start their Cloud journey. This program is called **[Visual Studio Dev Essentials](https://www.visualstudio.com/dev-essentials/)**.

With this program you can have access to some really useful resources. Let me give you some examples:

* Free Azure account + $200 for the first month
* Access to couple of free Azure services
* 3 months of free access to **[Pluralsight](https://www.pluralsight.com/)**
* MSDN magazine - Digital edition
* 3 months of **[LinkedIn Learning](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/)** access for free

It's highly encouraged to register and activate these learning benefits.

*My personal recommendation is to start with the Pluralsight subscription and later when you activate your access for LinkedIn Learning you can update your profile with the completed courses.*
