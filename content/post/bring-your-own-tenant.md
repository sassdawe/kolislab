BYOT is a new concept I learned while I was listening to the [M365 Dev Podcast](https://m365devpodcast.com/).

One of the benefits of BYOT is that you can say things like this:

> It works in my tenant ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

On a more serious note: [this is how you can get a personal Developer tenant](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office/developer-program/microsoft-365-developer-program) for your sandboxing/developer needs. **Have fun!**
