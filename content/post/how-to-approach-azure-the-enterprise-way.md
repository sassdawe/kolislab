title: How to approach Azure, the Enterprise way (part 1)
---


Microsoft does a really good job making it easy to get started with Azure which is perfect if you're an induvidual just wanting to learn or if you work for a small business where you don't have to follow any procurement process and you don't need to comply with regulations. 

But if you're working in a huge enterprise where you have a formal IT organization with many departments and procedures to follow which were inspired by **#ITIL** then you need a completly different approach with some plannig before you start giving subscriptions to every people in your organization.

I prefer to call it the **Enterprise way** 

### How do you know this is your way?
Let me ask you some questions:
* Do you have Change Control procedures?
* Do you have to implement Segregation of Duties?
* Do you have Patch Management processes?
* Do you have Operations, Technical Support and Engineering teams for the same technology? 
* Does your organization using external service providers to out source some of the less valuable work?

If your answare was *yes* at least for two questions I encurage you to keep reading :)

### Getting started with the Enterprise way

The first thing you'll need is **Azure Active Directory**, if you have Office 365 or an Intune subscription then you already have one Azure Active Directory.

Suggest that you need at least three Azure AD. Why? 
Because you'll need Dev, Test and Production instances.
