title: State of Office 365 management with PowerShell
---


These days if you want go manage Office 365 and I mean really manage it, manage the small services as well and not just the licensing and the main pillars, you need to use a handful of different PowerShell modules.

In this post I try to summarize all these different modules and how can you get them.

This is the first post in a series of posts trying to help you get along with PowerShell and Office 365.

### The modules

You can get the list and the download link as well



The blog posts to describe the modules will arrive in the next couple of weeks.
