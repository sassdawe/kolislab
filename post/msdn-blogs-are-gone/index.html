<p><strong>ZDNET</strong> wrote an article about the planned <em>clean-up</em> the back in November of 2018: <a href=https://www.zdnet.com/article/as-microsoft-moves-more-blogs-off-its-msdn-and-technet-sites-heres-how-to-stay-current/>https://www.zdnet.com/article/as-microsoft-moves-more-blogs-off-its-msdn-and-technet-sites-heres-how-to-stay-current/</a></p>
<p>But oddly this act was a surprise to some current and former MSFT employees: <a href="https://social.microsoft.com/Forums/Azure/en-US/4c3cee58-dbb5-4cfe-bab5-b751de54382a/why-was-my-msdn-blog-deleted?forum=Profile">Why was my MSDN blog deleted?</a></p>
<p>This <strong>housecleaning</strong> from Microsoft hit me hard because for me sometimes MSDN was the savior especially because I work with SharePoint. I even help out people of different forums by using links to point to blog articles from MSDN as a reference.</p>
<h3 id=what-can-we-do-to-access-what-is-left>
What can we do to access what is left?
<a class=heading-link href=#what-can-we-do-to-access-what-is-left>
<i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden=true></i>
</a>
</h3>
<p>Some blogs were migrated to the <a href=https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/>Microsoft Tech Community</a> portal, or they are still migrated, we just have to give some time to the search engines to crawl them. Some will keep their authors, some will become Anonymous post</p>
<p>And some will not make it ðŸ˜¥</p>
<p>As Ned mentioned in his post on twitter (in the picture above with the red mark around it), we can use the <a href=https://archive.org/web/>Internet Archive</a> to access the deleted blogs and articles.</p>

<p>Actually, I&rsquo;m in a process to export some of the blog posts using the <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/onenote-web-clipper/gojbdfnpnhogfdgjbigejoaolejmgdhk?hl=en"><strong>OneNote Web Clipper</strong></a> Chrome extension to clip the articles and send them into my dedicated <strong>OneNote</strong> notebook.</p>
